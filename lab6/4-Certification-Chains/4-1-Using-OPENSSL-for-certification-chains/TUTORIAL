SRSC 2223 Labs, hj

This is a very simple tutorial, to teach you how to create any kind of
certificate or certificate chain you want, if you want to use the
openssl tool
Of course, if you want toc reate something which can be used in a final
internet production environment, you need to find a trusted CA ;-)

But here we are going through how a certificate chain is
created. If you want to know about keystore, you can refer to
the different keystore types in Java (as you find in other Labs)

======================


# Creation of Certiifcation Chains using openssl as a PKI Tool
#
# 1. Create our Root CA Certificate
#
openssl genrsa -out RootCA.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 1500 -key RootCA.key -out RootCA.crt
#
# 2. Create an Intermediary Certificate
#
openssl genrsa -out IntermediateCA.key 4096
openssl req -new -key IntermediateCA.key -out IntermediateCA.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 265 -in IntermediateCA.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key  -CAcreateserial -out IntermediateCA.crt
#
#
# 3. Now the final (third-level) certificate
#
openssl genrsa -out SAAHServer.key 2048
openssl req -new -key SAAHServer.key -out SAAHServer.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in SAAHServer.csr -CA IntermediateCA.crt -CAkey IntermediateCA.key -set_serial 0101 -out SAAHServer.crt -sha256
#
#
# Now you can put the certificated in a list (top-down or down-top for ex)
#
# So any third level entity can send the chain ...
# And the other entities only need to trust in the RootCA
#

# For all above ...
# You have also a complete tutorial, with similar steps in:
# https://www.golinuxcloud.com/create-certificate-authority-root-ca-linux/
# showing the same essential thing: how to create a "certificate authority"
# and sign a certificate with teh root CA (e.g., signing the chained
# certificates with the provate key of the pair in the rot of trust
# (represented by the root certificate - the CA certificate, the one
# you will use in a certificate store used as a trusted store.
