Analyze code examples.
It is all about programming with Symmetric Cryptography,
using Block-Oriented Algorithms (or Block Ciphers):

Here you must learn about the use of MODES when using
Symmetric Encryption and Block Ciphers.

================================================================
Follow the Lab:

1) About Symmetric Crypto and Block-Based Encryption Algorithms
   and the use of MODES (Parameterization of MODES)

- How to use different modes when using Block based Symmetric Encryption ?
- Try to observe some effects when you change the modes.
  Hint: Observe the size of cipgertext compared with plaintext
        What modes expanded the ciphertext ?
	
- Observe that only certain modes (ex., CBC, CBR, OFB, CFB, among
  others) need to be used with a required parameterization of 
  Initialization  Vectors ...
  
  See, for example, that when you use ECB mode you dont need the
  IV - Initialization Vector. Why ?
  
- Why we must use different modes for different purposes ?
  See the relevance of using different modes... and the
  relevance of the use of different initialization vectors
  when we don't change the key

- Finally you can observe that:
  *) You cannot use keys of any sizes for each symmetric algorithm:
     Each symmetric algorithm has its own admissible key sizes:
     Ex: AES: 128, 192 or 256 bit key
         RC6: 128, 192 or 256 bit key
	 TWOFISH: 128, 192, 256 bit key
	 CAMELIA: 128, 192, 256 bit key 
 	 SERPENT: 128, 192, 256 bit key
	 MARS:128, 192, 256 bit key
	 IDEA: 128 bit key
	 KASUMI: 128 bit key
         SEED: 128 bit key	 
	 SKIPJACK: 80 bit key
	 CAST-128: 40, 128 bit key
         Blowfish: 64, 126, 256, 448 bit keys
	 DES: 56 (in fact only 56 bits used)
	 TrileDES (or DESede): 112, 168 bit keys
	 

2) About Symmetric Crypto and the Relevance of PADDING parameterization

- How to use different padding methods in Block-Oriented Ciphers?
- Why we need Paading ? When we need padding ?
- Is padding a relevant security association parameter ? Why ?
- What is the relevance of using standardized padding methods ?
- In our lab examples we are using always the standard PKCS5 padding ....
  But other padding methods exist: PKCS7 (rfc5652), ZEROPadding, ANSIX9.23, 
  ISO/IEC 9797-1 (or rfc 1321), ISO 10126, ISO/IEC 7816-4

Ok, you learned that you need padding, how, why and when...
You also understood why padding must be provided when you
want to encrypt input plaintext (messages, files ...) with
sizes that are not multiple of the base blocksize processed by
the desired crypto algorithm ... 
So, in general ... you will tend to use always PADDING.

You must take into account that:

- Symmetric Block-Based Algorithms process Blocks
- Each algorithm adopts a blocksize as characteristic (fixed)
- So, consequently this also determines the sizes of Initialization
  vectors, when using certain modes

  Ex: 
      DES, TripeDES, Blowfish, RC5, IDEA, 
      KASUMI, SKIPJACK, CAST (among many others...) use 64 bit blocks

      AES, RC6, Twofish, MARS, SERPENT, 
      CAMELIA, SEED, (among others...) use 128 bit blocks
