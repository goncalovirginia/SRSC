Download the archive streaming.tgz.
Follow the next steps (following also explanations in class).

Step 1. 
-------
Compile, run and learn what the code do (hjStreamingServer and
hjProxy). You can use the VLC tool to play the streamed-movies from
the Streaming Server or proxied by the hjProxy.

The movie frames are sent  not encrypited (cleartext frames), as you
can see.

VLC is avaliable at: 
https://www.videolan.org/




Step 2.
------

Challenge: modify the Streaming server and the proxy to support
encrypted streaming. Each movie frame is sent encrypted.
You can use AES, keys with sizes of 128 or 256 bits.
For the encryption/decryption mode use CTR mode and for padding use PKCS5Padding
(as seen before in exercises ex1 and ex2).

Your VLC must be able to play the movie correctly, in real time
streaming received from the Proxy (that will decryot the transmission).

Try to do this in the class or you can finish off-line until next week.
