Just see the code and understand what is there ... 
Compile and verify the run

As you see, we are generating dynamically the symmetric key for the
used algorithm (same construction for any other symmetric algorithm).

In the discussed example for Encryption/Decryption we are using the mode GCM !
As we will see in Lectrues (Tehory), this mode, as others modes (ex.,
CCM), process encryption/decryption blocs for block-oriented ciphers 
in which the processing includes a MAC (as a proof of integrity).
So, the decryption processing implictly can verify the integrity of the
received ciphertext (something that you do by adding explicit Hashes or
MACs (HMACs or CMACs) when using modes like ECB, CCB, CFB, OFB or CTR.

This is why GCM or CCM modes are called cipher block modes of
operation with implicit message integrity guarantees).

You can see that in the example that GCM expands ciphertext compared with the plaintext ...
... a lot ... 
What is GCM adding ??? Interesting question for the discussion in
lectures.
