TODO:
Well, here you have only some "cooking recipes" as
examples to use the keytool tool.

Well, lots of options, etc etc ... Is it "complex, boring ...;-( ??  "
you can also use KeyStore Explorer - if you only like GUI things !

But !!!!
Dont be afraid of shell command tools with lots of options. 
You must live with them !!!!

Manual Pages help you:

$man keytool    // in this case
